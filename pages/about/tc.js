          community.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have created some terms and conditions (the Rules) which set out
          the terms for your use of FiveStarWeek community Please read the
          following Rules carefully, as they provide information about using the
          Community in a way that is respectful and lawful. By using, or
          submitting material to, the Community you agree that have read,
          understood, accept, and agree to abide by, these Rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms, conditions and policies that apply to specific social
          networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also apply to the FiveStarWeek
          profiles they host. We recommend that you familiarise yourself with
          those terms and conditions before participating in the Community and
          we disclaim any liability associated with your use of those services,
          or for your failure to view or comply with their terms, conditions and
          policies. Where there is a conflict between these Rules and the terms
          and conditions of the relevant social media channels, the social media
          channels&rsquo; terms and conditions will prevail.

          <strong>Moderation of the community</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          We strive to create dialogue with users of our Community and encourage
          you to share content via the Community in accordance with these Rules
          (Contribution).
        </p>
        <p>
          We will try to check that all submissions to the Community comply with
          our acceptable use standards described below (Acceptable Use
          Standards) as soon as reasonably practicable after publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          If in our opinion an individual makes use of the Community in breach
          of these Rules, we reserve the right to remove, or to disable access
          to, any Contribution, and to terminate, suspend or change the
          conditions of their access to the Community without prior warning. We
          also reserve the right to bring legal proceedings against any
          individual for a breach of the Rules, or take such other action as we

        </p>
        <p>

          the use of the Community by any person in contravention of these
          Rules.
          <br /> While we try to moderate the Community, we are not legally
          responsible for any material posted by third parties and we may stop,
          or suspend, moderating the Community at any time.

        <h3>
          <strong>Important points</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The views expressed by any individual within the Community are those
            of the individual and do not necessarily reflect the views of
            FiveStarWeek.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any medical advice or information posted to the Community should not
            be regarded as advice on which any reliance should be placed. We
            therefore disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any
            reliance placed on such materials by a user of the Community, or by
            anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. You must always
            seek medical advice from your doctor or a suitably qualified medical
            professional.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any advice or information posted to the Community should not be
            accepted as true or correct. It is up to individual users to check
            the validity of any advice or information before relying on it,
            especially where the consequences of following it could be serious.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes FiveStarWeek automatically follows back users which follow
            FiveStarWeek profiles within the Community. A follow-back does not
            constitute an endorsement; the same applies to re-tweeting or
            sharing messages posted on accounts that FiveStarWeek does not own,
            or marking them as favourites, or otherwise sharing information on a
            different platform.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>
          The Community is intended for use by individuals aged 18 years or
          more. Minors must get permission from their parent or guardian before
          using the Community. We recommend that parents who allow their
          children to use the Community discuss online safety with their
          children first and that parents endeavour to monitor any use of the
          Community. Minors should also be given guidance on how to use the
          Community safely and in a way that complies with these Rules.
        </p>
