          FiveStarWeek may use cookies in connection with operation of its web
          sites. If you visit any restricted access or password protected
          portions of FiveStarWeek&rsquo;s web sites, you may be required to use
          cookies, which may include or be linked to personally identifiable
          data. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on your
          computer by the FiveStarWeek&rsquo;s web site server. Cookies are used

          access or password protected portions of FiveStarWeek&rsquo;s web
          sites. This allows FiveStarWeek to personalize or regulate the use of
          the site, and also permits FiveStarWeek to automate the access and
          data-entry functions of the site (e.g., login information), to tailor
          the appearance or presentation of the site to your preferences or
          interests. In general, we do not use cookies to track the navigational
          habits of identified users without the user consent. If you visit our

          collect is statistical only (e.g., the domain from which you access
          the Internet, the date and time you access our site, and the Internet
          address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site)
          and not personally identifiable. We use this information about the
          number of visitors and their use of the sites in aggregate form to
          make our sites more useful and attractive to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of cookies is common in the industry, and they are used at
          most major web sites. Cookies will not be used to pass any information
          from your computer except the specific information placed into the
          cookie from one participating FiveStarWeek&rsquo;s web site when the
          cookie is retrieved by another participating FiveStarWeek&rsquo;s web
          site. You may wish to adjust your Web browser to inform you whenever a
          cookie is to be used, or to reject all cookies automatically. However,
          if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the web site may not
          function properly or permit access.

          legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement
          offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief
          that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or
          Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or
          other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the
          rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general
          public.
          <br /> <br /> We and our affiliates will share / sell some or all of
          your personal information with another business entity should we (or
          our assets) plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business
          entity, or re-organization, amalgamation, restructuring of business.
          Should such a transaction occur that other business entity (or the new
          combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with
          respect to your personal information.
